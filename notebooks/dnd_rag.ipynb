    "# RAG with Evaluation: Film Box Office ROI Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an **agentic RAG system** that analyzes film financial performance by:\n",
    "- Extracting production budgets and box office grosses from Wikipedia\n",
    "- Calculating Return on Investment (ROI)\n",
    "- Classifying film performance (Blockbuster, Profitable, Break-even, Flop)\n",
    "- **Evaluating** against ground truth data\n",
    "\n",
    "This goes beyond simple question-answering—it requires **multi-step reasoning, calculations, and decision-making**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Use Case?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike simple Q&A, this agent must:\n",
    "1. **Extract** budget and gross from unstructured text\n",
    "2. **Calculate** ROI = (gross - budget) / budget × 100\n",
    "3. **Classify** performance based on thresholds\n",
    "4. **Verify** calculations against ground truth\n",
    "\n",
    "At Cohere, all RAG calls come with... **precise citations**! 🎉\n",
    "The model cites which groups of words, in the RAG chunks, were used to generate the final answer.  \n",
    "These citations make it easy to check where the model's generated response claims are coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The baseline agent and eval harness are intentionally minimal to demonstrate systematic improvement through the eval-driven development cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG consists of 3 steps:\n",
    "- Step 1: Index film Wikipedia pages and retrieve relevant chunks\n",
    "- Step 2: Optionally, rerank the retrieved chunks\n",
    "- Step 3: Generate financial analysis with **precise citations**\n",

    "### What We Built:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: RAG Tutorial**\n",
    "- ✅ Document chunking and embedding with `embed-v4.0`\n",
    "- ✅ Vector similarity search (cosine similarity)\n",
    "- ✅ Reranking with `rerank-v3.5`\n",
    "- ✅ Generation with `command-a-reasoning-08-2025` and **citations**\n",
    "- ✅ Citation formatting utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Evaluation**\n",
    "- ✅ Test queries on the same dataset\n",
    "- ✅ Automated evaluation with keyword coverage\n",
    "- ✅ Pass/fail analysis by difficulty\n",
    "- ✅ Detailed results inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAG improves accuracy** by grounding responses in retrieved documents\n",
    "2. **Citations build trust** by showing which sources were used\n",
    "3. **Reranking boosts performance** by prioritizing the most relevant chunks\n",
    "4. **Evaluation is essential** to measure and improve RAG systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Try different parameters**: Experiment with chunk sizes, top-k values, temperature\n",
    "- **Add more test queries**: Create a larger evaluation set\n",
    "- **Improve retrieval**: Try different embedding models or hybrid search\n",
    "- **Enhance evaluation**: Add more sophisticated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, LLM-as-judge)\n",
